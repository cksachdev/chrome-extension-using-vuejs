```notes
Difference in rendered output???

- Your theme is applied only to the markdown you write.
- JSX will not inherit theme styles.

## Pro/Con - Upsides

- Built on top of markdown & jsx
- Markdown is quick & easy to write
- Responsive slides
- Iteractivity & demos (as components) baked into the slides
- Runs locally or in the cloud.
- Publish and share with github, bitbucket, other vcs
- Export to different formats (html, pdf)
- Open source

‚ú®The limit is what you can create ‚ú®

<Notes>

- Built on technology you work with
  - Having to learn & stay up-to-date with specific software just for presentations (like MS PowerPoint)
- Runs locally
  - No need for special software to run it (no "runs on my machine" bs)
  - Consider deploying to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) (free) or [netlify] (http://whoisryosuke.com/blog/2018/mdx-deck-on-netlify/) using built-in [continuous deployment] (https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/)
- Easy to publish, share/work with(in) a team
  - github, bit bucket, other vcs
- Open source
  - Open source - you can contribute and share your work with others!

**Other tools out there:**

- Microsoft PowerPoint
- Google Slides
- [slides](https://slides.com/features)
- [spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle) ReactJS based presentation library
- [reveal](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
