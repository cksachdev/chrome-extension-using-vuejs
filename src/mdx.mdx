## What is a Chrome extension?

<!-- show an typewriter animation with the end as a smily/heart gif -->
**Extensions** are small software programs that customize the browsing experience. They enable users to tailor **Chrome** functionality and behavior to individual needs or preferences. They are built on web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

<Notes>
**What is mdx?** A blending together markdown & jsx. More concretely, it's a markdown parser, loader and jsx renderer.

- **Powerful:** MDX blends Markdown and JSX syntax
- **Customizable**: Decide which component is rendered for each Markdown element (`{ h1: MyHeading }`).
- **Markdown-based**: The simplicity and elegance of Markdown remains, you interleave JSX only when you want to.
- **Blazingly blazing fast**: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs during the build stage

**...but why use it?** It's extremely useful to quickly design system components, interweaving existing components with markdown.

## Example of Customized MDX

```js
/* ./components */
export const BlinkingText = ({ children: title }) => (
    <h1 className="blinkingText">
        {title}
    </h1>
)
```
Set the component inside your theme

```js
/* ./themes/MyTheme.js */
components: { h6: BlinkingText }
```
